# üí´ About Me:
‚Äçüíª I am a Machine Learning Engineer at The Citco Group Limited. Before joining The Citco Group Limited, I worked as Data Scientist at Skyjack Inc. and Machine Learning Researcher at Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Energy Mechatronics Lab (University of Alberta). I am experienced in creating end-to-end data-driven solutions that can be deployed on edge or cloud platforms. I have experience working with different AWS platforms, such as AWS SakeMaker, S3, EC2, and Lambda, to develop and deploy ML models. I have a solid understanding of the entire data pipeline, from data collection to deployment, and can design and implement data solutions that meet the specific needs of a business.

As a machine learning engineer, I have a strong background in data engineering and big data processing. I am proficient in Apache Spark, and have experience working with Databricks, a platform for data engineering and data science built on top of Spark. I have experience in data processing, transformation, and cleaning, and I can work with large datasets and perform complex data operations efficiently.

Furthermore, I am passionate about teaching and content creation in the field of data and machine learning. I have developed and taught a Machine Learning course at the University of Alberta, and created 50+ practical examples for the students. Additionally, I have held two workshops with 120+ attendees, covering various topics in ML, computer vision, and transfer learning. I believe in the power of education and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. With my experience in data engineering, machine learning, and teaching, I am confident in my ability to help businesses make data-driven decisions and achieve their goals.
