- ‍💻 I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience developing and deploying end-to-end data-driven solutions on edge and cloud. I have 6+ years of experience developing Python code and 2+ utilizing SQL. I have developed models by hand-coding equations from scratch or using frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Spark MLlib. I also worked with different AWS platforms, such as AWS SakeMaker, S3, EC2, and Lambda, to develop and deploy ML models. As an engineer, I like creating end-to-end solutions for businesses and bringing data to practical decisions for end users. I like teaching and content creation in the domain of data and machine learning. I created a Machine Learning course at the University of Alberta, including ML basics, computer vision, natural language processing, and time series. I developed 50+ practical examples. In addition, I hold two workshops with 120+ attendees in ML, computer vision, and transfer learning.
